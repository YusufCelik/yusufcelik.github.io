(Mughnee, K. *) As to the associating in the same case, Akh and the Koofees assert that it sometimes fails to have this property, by its occurring redundantly, so as not to be a conjunction at all; and they hold to accord with this assertion the saying in the Kur [ix. 119], <foreign lang="ar">حَتَّى إِذَا ضَاقَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْأَرْضُ بِمَا رَحُبَتْ وَضَاقَتْ</foreign>

(Mughnee.) And as to its denoting order, some hold that there are exs. of its not necessarily implying this; (Mughnee, K; *) one of which is the saying in the Kur [xxxix. 8], <foreign lang="ar">خَلَقَكُمْ مِنْ نَفْسٍ</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">وَاحِدَةٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِنْهَا زَوْجَهَا</foreign>: (Mughnee: [in which are added other similar exs., one of which is given in the K:]) but to this there are five replies: 1st, that this passage is elliptical; the meaning being, <hi rend="ital">He created you from one person</hi> (<hi rend="ital">which He originated</hi>); <hi rend="ital">then He made therefrom its mate:</hi> 2nd, that the meaning is, <hi rend="ital">He created you from a person that was alone; then</hi> &amp;c.: 3rd, that the progeny of Adam were made to come forth from his back like little ants; then Eve was created from his [rib called the] <foreign lang="ar">قُصَيْرَى</foreign>: 4th, that the creation of Eve from Adam being unusual, <foreign lang="ar">ثمّ</foreign> is used to notify its order and posteriority in respect of wonderfulness and of the manifestation of power; not to denote order and posteriority of time: 5th, that <foreign lang="ar">ثمّ</foreign> is here used to denote the order of enunciation; not the virtual order: the replies preceding this last are better than it, inasmuch as they verify the order and the delay; whereas the last verifies the order only, as there is no delay between the two enunciations; but the last reply is of more common application, applying to the ex. given above and to others: (Mughnee:) Fr says that the meaning of the ex. given above is, <hi rend="ital">He created you from a person</hi> (<hi rend="ital">which He created</hi>) <hi rend="ital">single; then</hi> &amp;c.; and in like manner says Zj. (T.) And as to its denoting a delay, Fr asserts that sometimes this is not the case, as is shown by the saying, <foreign lang="ar">أَعْجَبَنِى مَا صَنَعْتَ اليَوْمَ</foreign> 
                  <foreign lang="ar">ثُمَّ مَا صَنَعْتَ أَمْسِ أَعْجَبُ</foreign> [<hi rend="ital">What thou didst to-day excited my wonder,</hi> or <hi rend="ital">admiration,</hi> or <hi rend="ital">pleasure; then</hi> (<hi rend="ital">I tell thee</hi>) <hi rend="ital">what thou didst yesterday was more wonderful,</hi> or <hi rend="ital">admirable,</hi> or <hi rend="ital">pleasing</hi>]; for <foreign lang="ar">ثمّ</foreign> is here used to denote the order of the enunciation; not a delay between the two enunciations. (Mughnee, K. *)          <sense type="b" n="2">-b2-</sense>  [It is said that] it denotes order and a delay when it conjoins single words: but Akh says that it has the meaning of <foreign lang="ar">وَ</foreign> [<hi rend="ital">And</hi>], because it is used in cases in which there is no order; as in <foreign lang="ar">وَٱللّٰهِ ثُمَّ وَٱللّٰهِ لَأَفْعَلَنَّ</foreign> [<hi rend="ital">By God, and</hi> (<hi rend="ital">I say again,</hi>) <hi rend="ital">By God, I will assuredly do</hi> such a thing]: and when it conjoins propositions, it does not necessarily denote order, but has the meaning of <foreign lang="ar">وَ</foreign>: (Msb:) it has the meaning of <foreign lang="ar">وَ</foreign>, (S, Msb,) the conjunction, (S,) in the saying in the Kur [x. 47], <foreign lang="ar">ثُمَّ ٱللّٰهُ شَهِيدٌ عَلَى مَا يَفْعَلُونَ</foreign> [<hi rend="ital">And God is witness of what they do</hi>].
