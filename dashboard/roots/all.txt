(Mughnee.)          <sense type="b" n="4">-b4-</sense>  It is also used to denote predominance of application; as in <foreign lang="ar">المَدِينَةُ</foreign> [<hi rend="ital">The city</hi>], meaning the city of the Apostle; and <foreign lang="ar">الكِتَابُ</foreign> [<hi rend="ital">The book</hi>], meaning the book of Seebaweyh: and in this case, it may not be suppressed, except when the noun is used vocatively, or when it is prefixed to another noun which it governs in the gen. case; and in some anomalous instances, as in <foreign lang="ar">هٰذَا عَيُّوقٌ طَالِعًا</foreign> [<hi rend="ital">This</hi> 
                  <hi rend="ital">is the star Capella, rising</hi>], originally <foreign lang="ar">العَيُّوقٌ</foreign>. (I 'Ak p. 51.) [In a case of this kind, it is said in the Mughnee to be redundant; but I think it is clearly not so in any of the instances here mentioned, except the last; and this I would rather assign to a category yet to be noticed, in which <foreign lang="ar">ال</foreign> is certainly redundant, and, by rule, inseparable.]          <sense type="b" n="5">-b5-</sense>  It is also prefixed to a noun transferred from its original application to that of a proper name; it being so prefixed to convey an allusion to the original signification; and such noun being generally an epithet, as <foreign lang="ar">حَارِثٌ</foreign>; but sometimes an inf. n., as <foreign lang="ar">فَضْلٌ</foreign>; and sometimes a generic noun, as <foreign lang="ar">نُعْمَانٌ</foreign>; so that in any of these cases you may prefix <foreign lang="ar">ال</foreign>, saying <foreign lang="ar">الحَارِثُ</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">الفَضْلُ</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">النُّعْمَانُ</foreign>, with a view to the original signification; and you may suppress it, with a view to the actual state [which is that of a proper name]: for when you mean that a name of this kind is given as one ominous of good, you prefix the <foreign lang="ar">ال</foreign> in order to indicate this; as when you say <foreign lang="ar">الحَارِثُ</foreign> with a view to a person's being thus named to prognosticate that he will live and be a tiller, or cultivator; but when you only consider it as a proper name, you do not prefix the <foreign lang="ar">ال</foreign>: thus the prefix <foreign lang="ar">ال</foreign> conveys a meaning not obtained without it; and therefore it is not redundant, as some assert it to be. (I 'Ak p. 50.) [The author of the Mughnee is one of those who consider <foreign lang="ar">ال</foreign> redundant in this case.]          <sense type="b" n="6">-b6-</sense>  It is in some cases redundant: and in some of these, it is inseparable; as in [a proper name which cannot be used with a view to an original application from which it has been transferred to that of a proper name though it may have been so transferred, such as] <foreign lang="ar">اللَّاتُ</foreign>, which is the name of a certain idol that was at Mekkeh [so called because a man used to moisten <foreign lang="ar">سَوِيق</foreign> with clarified butter, for the pilgrims, at the place thereof]; and, accord. to some, [as before mentioned,] in <foreign lang="ar">الآنِ</foreign>; and in the conjunct nouns <foreign lang="ar">الَّذِى</foreign> and its variations, accord. to those who hold that a noun of this kind is rendered determinate by its complement: in other cases, where it is redundant, it is separable; and this is when it is prefixed to a proper name by poetic licence, as in <foreign lang="ar">بَنَاتُ الأَوْبَرِ</foreign> for <foreign lang="ar">بَنَاتُ أَوْبَرَ</foreign>, a species of truffle; or, accord. to Mbr, this is not a proper name, and the <foreign lang="ar">ال</foreign> is not redundant; and when it is prefixed to a specificative, as in <foreign lang="ar">طِبْتَ النَّفْسَ</foreign> for <foreign lang="ar">طِبْتَ نَفْسًا</foreign>, accord. to the Basrees, who hold, in opposition to the Koofees, that the specificative may only be indeterminate; (I 'Ak p. 49;) [and, in like manner, as redundant and separable,] it is irregularly prefixed [by poetic licence] in <foreign lang="ar">الأَمْسِ</foreign> [q. v.], when it is left in its original form with kesr. (T.)          <sense type="b" n="7">-b7-</sense>  Accord. to the Koofees, and some of the Basrees, and many of the later authors, it may also supply the place of the affixed pronoun; and such they hold to be the case in the saying in the Kur [lxxix. 41], <foreign lang="ar">فَإِنَّ ٱلْجَنَّةَ هِىَ ٱلْمَأوِى</foreign> [<hi rend="ital">Verily Paradise, it shall be his place of abode</hi>]; and in <foreign lang="ar">مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ حَسَنٍ الوَجْهُ</foreign> [<hi rend="ital">I passed by a man beautiful in his face</hi>]; and <foreign lang="ar">ضُرِبَ زَيْدٌ الظَّهْرُ وَالبَطْنُ</foreign> [<hi rend="ital">Zeyd was beaten, his back and his belly</hi>]; when <foreign lang="ar">الوجه</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">الظهر</foreign> and <foreign lang="ar">البطن</foreign> are thus in the nom. case: but those who deny its being used in this manner hold that <foreign lang="ar">لَهُ</foreign> is to be understood in the verse of the Kur, and <foreign lang="ar">مِنْهُ</foreign> in the other examples: and Ibn-Málik restricts the licence to cases not including the <foreign lang="ar">صِلَة</foreign> [or complement of <foreign lang="ar">ال</foreign> used in the manner which is here next to be explained]. (Mughnee.)          <sense type="b" n="8">-b8-</sense>  It is also a conjunct noun in the sense of <foreign lang="ar">الَّذِى</foreign> and its variations; and as such is prefixed to an act. part. n., and to a pass. part. n., and, as some say, to a simple epithet; (Mughnee, and I' Ak p. 43;) as <foreign lang="ar">الضَّارِبُ</foreign> [which is equivalent to <foreign lang="ar">الَّذِى يَضْرِبُ</foreign>], and <foreign lang="ar">المَضْرُوبُ</foreign> [which is equivalent to <foreign lang="ar">الَّذِى ضُرِبَ</foreign>], and <foreign lang="ar">الحَسَنُ الوَجْهِ</foreign>: (I 'Ak:) but this last not to be regarded, as it cannot be rendered by means of a verb. (Mughnee.) As such, also, it is sometimes prefixed to an adverbial noun, (Mughnee and I 'Ak,) extraordinarily; (I 'Ak;) as in the saying, <quote>
                     <L> 
                        <foreign lang="ar">مَنْ لَا يَزَالُ شَاكِرًا عَلَى يلْمَعَهْ</foreign>

As such it is also sometimes prefixed to a nominal proposition; as in the saying, <quote>
                     <L> 
                        <foreign lang="ar">مَنَ القَوْمِ الرَّسُولُ ٱللّٰهِ مِنْهُمْ</foreign>

                        <foreign lang="ar">لَهُمْ دَانَتْ رِقَابُ بِنَي مَعَدِّ</foreign>

(Mughnee and I 'Ak.) And as such it is also sometimes prefixed to a verbal proposition, of which the verb is an aor.; which shows that it is not [in this case] a particle of determination; (Mughnee;) as in the phrase, <foreign lang="ar">صَوْتُ الحِمَارِ اليُجَدَّعُ</foreign> [<hi rend="ital">The voice of the ass that has his ear,</hi> or <hi rend="ital">ears, cut off</hi>]. (T and Mughnee.) But all these three cases are peculiar to poetry; contrary to the opinion of Akh, and, with respect to the last case, to that of Ibn-Málik. (Mughnee.) [Respecting the last instance, see also art. <foreign lang="ar">جدع</foreign>.] Another instance of its usage prefixed in this sense to an aor. is the saying, <quote>
                     <L>

                  </quote> [<hi rend="ital">Thou art not the judge whose judgment is approved</hi>]; (IAmb, T, I 'Ak) a saying of ElFarezdak: (IAmb, T:) it is an extraordinary case; (I 'Ak;) and is [said to be] an instance of a bad poetic license, the like of which in prose would be an error by common consent. (Expos. of the Shudhoor edh-Dhahab.) In like manner, one says, accord. to AZ, <foreign lang="ar">هٰذَا اليَضْرِبُكَ</foreign>, meaning <hi rend="ital">This is he who beats thee;</hi> and <foreign lang="ar">رَأَيْتُ اليَضْرِبُكَ</foreign>
